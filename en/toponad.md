- If you do not have an account with TopOn aggregate advertising platform, please go to [TopOn](https://app.toponad.com/#/register) to register and follow the [Guide Document](https://docs.toponad.com/#/en-us/android/GetStarted/TopOn_Get_Started) for the corresponding configuration, or the `AppKey` and `AppID` parameters required by the service panel.

* <font color="red">Note: TopOn aggregate ads need to create different AppIDs on iOS and Android platforms, and the two cannot share the same AppID</font>


### Verify whether the service is integrated successfully

- After completing the **TopOn** service access steps, you only need to add two lines of code when the script starts to verify whether the service is successfully connected, the code is as follows:

```ts
// Enable log
topon.toponService.setLogDebug(true);
// Check the integration of third-party ads
topon.toponService.integrationChecking();

```

- After the project is run on the phone, you can see the integration status of the ad in the Android Studio run log or Logcat and Xcode run log.

* <font color="red">Note: On the iOS platform of TopOn, if you select Admob or StartApp ads, the above test results will prompt the ad verification failure, but in fact, the integration is successful, just ignore it.</font>

## Developer Guide

### 1. Create a banner ad

```ts
getBanner(placementId: string, listener?: BannerListener): Banner;
```

**Parameter Description**：

| Parameter | Description | 
| :---------- | :------------- |  
|  placementId | placementId | 
|  listener | Callback listener, if it is not passed, the setAdListener method of the returned object must be called to display, otherwise the advertisement callback will not be accepted | 

**Example**：

```js
// See the BannerListener interface in the TopOn API Reference for details
let listener = {
    ...
}
let banner = topon.toponService.getBanner("placementId", listener);
```

### 2. Load the ad
```ts
loadBanner(settings?: {
            banner_ad_size_struct?: {
                width: number;
                height: number;
            };
            width?: number;
            height?: number;
            adaptive_width?: number;
            adaptive_orientation?: 0 | 1 | 2;
            inline_adaptive_width?: number;
            inline_adaptive_orientation?: 0 | 1 | 2;
        }): void;
```

Call this interface to load the advertisement data. If the advertisement listener is not set when the created advertisement is created, choose to call the following interface to set the advertisement listener

```ts
setAdListener(listener: BannerListener): void;
```

When the advertisement is loaded, the `onBannerAdLoaded` callback will be triggered. After receiving this destruction, the interface can be called to display the advertisement.

|  settings | Advertising extra configuration |

            width: number;
